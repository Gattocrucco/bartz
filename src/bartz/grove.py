class TreeHeaps(Protocol):
    """A protocol for dataclasses that represent trees.

    A tree is represented with arrays as a heap. The root node is at index 1.
    The children nodes of a node at index :math:`i` are at indices :math:`2i`
    (left child) and :math:`2i + 1` (right child). The array element at index 0
    is unused.

    Parameters
    ----------
    leaf_tree
        The values in the leaves of the trees. This array can be dirty, i.e.,
        unused nodes can have whatever value.
    var_tree
        The axes along which the decision nodes operate. This array can be
        dirty but for the always unused node at index 0 which must be set to 0.
    split_tree
        The decision boundaries of the trees. The boundaries are open on the
        right, i.e., a point belongs to the left child iff x < split. Whether a
        node is a leaf is indicated by the corresponding 'split' element being
        0. Unused nodes also have split set to 0. This array can't be dirty.

    Notes
    -----
    Since the nodes at the bottom can only be leaves and not decision nodes,
    `var_tree` and `split_tree` are half as long as `leaf_tree`.
