class Moves(MultichainModule):
    """
    Moves proposed to modify each tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    allowed
        Whether there is a possible move. If `False`, the other values may not
        make sense. The only case in which a move is marked as allowed but is
        then vetoed is if it does not satisfy `min_points_per_leaf`, which for
        efficiency is implemented post-hoc without changing the rest of the
        MCMC logic.
    grow
        Whether the move is a grow move or a prune move.
    num_growable
        The number of growable leaves in the original tree.
    node
        The index of the leaf to grow or node to prune.
    left
    right
        The indices of the children of 'node'.
    partial_ratio
        A factor of the Metropolis-Hastings ratio of the move. It lacks the
        likelihood ratio, the probability of proposing the prune move, and the
        probability that the children of the modified node are terminal. If the
        move is PRUNE, the ratio is inverted. `None` once
        `log_trans_prior_ratio` has been computed.
    log_trans_prior_ratio
        The logarithm of the product of the transition and prior terms of the
        Metropolis-Hastings ratio for the acceptance of the proposed move.
        `None` if not yet computed. If PRUNE, the log-ratio is negated.
    grow_var
        The decision axes of the new rules.
    grow_split
        The decision boundaries of the new rules.
    var_tree
        The updated decision axes of the trees, valid whatever move.
    affluence_tree
        A partially updated `affluence_tree`, marking non-leaf nodes that would
        become leaves if the move was accepted. This mark initially (out of
        `propose_moves`) takes into account if there would be available decision
        rules to grow the leaf, and whether there are enough datapoints in the
        node is instead checked later in `accept_moves_parallel_stage`.
    logu
        The logarithm of a uniform (0, 1] random variable to be used to
        accept the move. It's in (-oo, 0].
    acc
        Whether the move was accepted. `None` if not yet computed.
    to_prune
        Whether the final operation to apply the move is pruning. This indicates
        an accepted prune move or a rejected grow move. `None` if not yet
        computed.
