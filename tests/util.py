    """
    Check if two matrices are similar.

    Parameters
    ----------
    actual
    desired
        The two matrices to be compared. Must be scalars, vectors, or 2d arrays.
        Scalars and vectors are intepreted as 1x1 and Nx1 matrices, but the two
        arrays must have the same shape beforehand.
    rtol
    atol
        Relative and absolute tolerances for the comparison. The closeness
        condition is:

            ||actual - desired|| <= atol + rtol * ||desired||,

        where the norm is the matrix 2-norm, i.e., the maximum (in absolute
        value) singular value.
    tozero
        If True, use the following codition instead:

            ||actual|| <= atol + rtol * ||desired||

        So `actual` is compared to zero, and `desired` is only used as a
        reference to set the threshold.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the two matrices have different shapes.
