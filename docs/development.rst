Development
===========

Initial setup
-------------

`Fork <https://github.com/Gattocrucco/bartz/fork>`_ the repository on Github, then clone the fork:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone git@github.com:YourGithubUserName/bartz.git
    cd bartz

Install `R <https://cran.r-project.org>`_ and `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_ (for example, with `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ do :literal:`brew install r uv`). Then run

.. code-block:: shell

    make setup

to set up the Python and R environments.

The Python environment is managed by uv. To run commands that involve the Python installation, do :literal:`uv run <command>`. For example, to start an IPython shell, do :literal:`uv run ipython`. Alternatively, do :literal:`source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment in the current shell.

The R environment is automatically active when you use :literal:`R` in the project directory.

Pre-defined commands
--------------------

Development commands are defined in a makefile. Run :literal:`make` without arguments to list the targets.

Benchmarks
----------

The benchmarks are managed with `asv <https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_. The basic asv workflow is:

.. code-block:: shell

    uv run asv run      # run and save benchmarks on main branch
    uv run asv publish  # create html report
    uv run asv preview  #Â start a local server to view the report

:literal:`asv run` writes the results into files saved in :literal:`./benchmarks`. These files are tracked by git; consider deliberately not committing all results generated while developing.

There are a few make targets for common asv commands. The most useful command during development is

.. code-block:: shell

    make asv-quick ARGS='--bench <pattern>'

This runs only benchmarks whose name matches <pattern>, only once, within the working copy and current Python environment.

Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation for the current working copy, do

.. code-block:: shell

    make docs

To build the documentation for the latest release tag, do

.. code-block:: shell

    make docs-latest

To debug the documentation build, do

.. code-block:: shell

    make docs SPHINXOPTS='--fresh-env --pdb'
